\documentclass[a4paper, 12pt, openany]{book} %chose the paper size and font size. Openany ensures that all all chapters and similar may begin at any page, not only odd pages. For the introductory pages and appendices we want openany, but for chapter pages in the main content we want chapters to begin only on odd pages (right hand side). The book class ensures that the margins are automatically adjusted such that left hand pages are slightly moved to the left and vice versa at the right, which makes the thesis very readable and good looking when printed in bound book format.

% The title page:
% For NTNU students this page will be generated automatically when submitting your paper, and should not be included in the final file from Latex. Delete or comment out the title page setup. The final report should then start with the first page being the abstract. I have included a title page here so it is possible to see how it may look like, and for those who does not get an automatically generated title page. Of course you will need to change the names and titles etc. to your case.

%the title page should be an odd page (right hand side)
